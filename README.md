I built this app to demonstrate knowledge in responsive web developement integrated with back end management and real payment. This e-commerce application will include modern design and animations, the ability to add and edit products on the go using a Sanity, all advanced cart, and checkout functionalities, and most importantly, the complete integration with Stripe so that you can cover real payments.

What I learned from this project:

- Advanced React folder and file structure, hooks, and refs
- Advanced State Management of the entire application using React Context API
- Next.js file-based routing and data using server-side rendering and static generation
- Integrated Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process
- Managed the entire content of this app using Sanity.
